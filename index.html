	<div id="flip">About Me</div>
	<div id="panel">Here is a little bit about me. I was born in Frankfurt, Germany. I graduated from the University of Portland with B.S. in Life Science for Pre-Physical Therapy and minor in Athletic Training. After graduating I moved to Seattle. I love this city. I work at a skilled nursing facility as the Director of Rehab Assistant. The last few months I have started learning how to code and I love it. This is leading me to a new career path. I have enjoyed working in healthcare, but the healthcare system needs some work. So, I want to become a web developer to work for a healthcare startup or maybe start my own. In my spare time, I spend time with my friends and family. I enjoy traveling and experiencing new cultures. For fun I enjoy playing softball, going to the movies, and doing Pinspired crafts. Also, I recently became a Lyft driver, which is awesome! But, when I need some "me time" I will attempt a Harry Potter movie marathon or watch a new show on Netflix.</div>
